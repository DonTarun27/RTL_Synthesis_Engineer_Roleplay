# RTL Synthesis Open-Source Tools
## 1. Yosys Open-Source Tool v0.55
Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It primarily focuses on logic synthesis, converting Verilog code into a gate-level netlist. Yosys supports Verilog-2005 and provides a set of synthesis algorithms for various applications. It can also be used to map to different technologies like ASIC standard cells and some FPGAs. 
Here's a more detailed look:
Key Features and Capabilities:
RTL Synthesis: Yosys takes Register Transfer Level (RTL) Verilog code as input and produces a gate-level netlist as output. 
Verilog Support: It has extensive support for Verilog-2005. 
Synthesis Algorithms: Yosys provides a collection of synthesis algorithms for different domains. 
Technology Mapping: It can map designs to ASIC standard cell libraries and certain FPGA families like Xilinx 7-Series and Lattice iCE40/ECP5. 
BLIF, EDIF, BTOR, SMT-LIB Output: Yosys can convert Verilog to other formats like BLIF, EDIF, BTOR, and SMT-LIB.
Synthesis Scripts: Yosys allows users to combine synthesis passes using Tcl scripts to customize the synthesis process. 
Open Source: Yosys is an open-source project, meaning its source code is freely available and can be modified and distributed. 
OSS CAD Suite: Yosys is a core component of the OSS CAD Suite which provides a collection of open-source EDA tools. 
Use Cases:
Logic Synthesis:
The primary use case is to synthesize Verilog code into a gate-level representation for hardware implementation. 
FPGA Implementation:
Yosys can be used as part of an FPGA implementation flow, along with tools like nextpnr. 
ASIC Design:
Yosys can be used in ASIC design flows for logic synthesis and technology mapping. 
Customizable Synthesis:
Users can create custom synthesis scripts to tailor the process to their specific needs.
